"""
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing
order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements
in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function,
but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements
denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set
to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1.
The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
